we will make a chatting app and using node js and web socket that will estabnlish a connnection bnetween a user and client and make a chatting app li9ke whatsapp 
so its a real time chat app using web sockets
web sockets help in http response

it establish a link between server and client
or we can use it to solve http long polling 
so like http or https in web sockets we have ws and wss

here we use nodejs socket io

we can also make video call etc

it help in event based communication

so webserver can emit event and client can also listen to that event


here we use client server using go live and other is node server that will listen to everything

after frontend desigining open the terminal and write cd ./nodeserver

npm init

npm i socket.io
